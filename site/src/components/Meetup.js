              Scheduling meetings can often become a laborious process of
              coordination between organizers sending out invites and attendees
              providing their availability.
              <br />
              <br />
              Inspired by past difficulties with the popular scheduling platform When2meet,
              this project aimed to create a more efficient and usable solution for
              people providing their availability for group meetings. The design process began with
              mobile first in order to focus on usability issues before expanding to desktop.

          In work settings without shared calendars, many people rely on When2meet to coordinate
          groups meetings. Operating as a web app, When2meet has one person send out a link from
          the platform to the rest of their team members to gather their availability during a
          specified period of time. Although When2meet offers a convenient solution, the interface
          suffers from poor usability, lacking a mobile responsive site.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite simply starting off as personal inspiration for this project, When2meet
          was also then widely mentioned in user research, driving the general structure of the
          final interface I created.

          Given that students consistently need to schedule group meetings for clubs and projects
          without the use of organized systems (like Microsoft Outlook), I surveyed
          19 university students to understand key factors and pain points in
          diverse scheduling processes and methods. Survey questions focused on both the meeting
          organizer and invitee sides of scheduling.
          <br />
          <br />
          The survey responses showed a general trend of people finding scheduling group meetings
          to be a difficult process. The most commonly used tool was When2meet (14 out of 19
          respondents), matching the result that people prefer to collect availability before
          proposing a meeting time. Responses also showed that from both the meeting organizer
          side and the invitee side, people value fast communication and the ability to see
          the everyone&apos;s availability in one place.

          For interviews, I spoke with 2 undergraduate students and 1 graduate student who had
          previous corporate work experience as well. These students were selected for their
          experiences managing teams and clubs. I spoke with each of them on the factors that are
          most important to consider when sending out a meeting invite as well as thought processes
          when providing availability.
          <br />
          <br />
          Synthesis of comments from the interviews was consistent with survey results with people
          emphasizing the need to see all availability in one place and the ease of using When2meet
          in various workflows for scheduling meetings. The interviews confirmed When2meet&apos;s
          pain points of poor mobile usability and tedious process to input availability.

              Additionally, to maintain the convenience valued by users of When2meet, the interface
              was framed as a web app without need for an account. User testing was conducted
              after wireframing and the first iteration of a prototype with the full UI design.

        <div className="project-text">
          The first iteration of my solution focused on displaying the group&apos;s
          availability on the main page and having the user add their availability
          for a given day by clicking “Edit” on a card in the “My availability” section. Primary
          considerations in this first iteration included:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <div className="list-text">
                <span style={{ 'font-weight': '600' }}>Visual representation of availability </span>
                through differently shaded blocks (screen 1) to provide high-level information.
                This follows When2meet&apos;s method of displaying availability where a darker
                block indicates that more people in the group are available at the specified time.
                User research showed that meeting invitees are not as concerned with specific
                people&apos;s availability, only the number of people available at a given timeslot.
              </div>

                to give the user more control over how they interact with the interface (screen 4).
                The choice of interaction addresses how users disliked When2meet&apos;s imprecise
                method of dragging in a grid to indicate availability. Tapping/typing into larger
                input boxes would aim to increase precision and decrease frustration with errors.

          The second iteration of wireframes made minor adjustments to the

            <li>

                in &ldquo;My availability&rdquo; was changed to a back arrow in the upper-left
                corner to better indicate to a user how to return to the main &ldquo;Group
                availability&rdquo; view. A &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; button and back arrow
                were also added to the editing a day view.

                in the section for editing a specific day&apos;s availability was moved to be
                grouped closer to the existing timeslots a user has. This better associates the

                to supplement the original calendar view; the grid shows individual days
                while the original layout still gives an overview of all dates that a

                in the grid view to solve for the issue of not having the ability to compare
                personal and group availability in the previous prototype; a key indicates the

          As a student who has thought a lot about the pain points with group meeting scheduling,
          this project provided an opportunity to understand how people think about
          the digital tools and the factors that go into their processes. By conducting
          user research and testing, I learned to translate those key factors into
          visual representations of information that would be the most convenient to users.

          While the final solution addresses the main pain point of mobile usability,
          further exploration could be done on how the platform
          would appear from the organizer side. Since
          this project only focused on the invitee side, research on the
          other perspective could be an interesting way to complete an understanding
          of the problem. This current solution still explores a side of the problem
          that is impactful to understanding how people work to collaborate efficiently.
